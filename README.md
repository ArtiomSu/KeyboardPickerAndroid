# KeyboardPickerAndroid
Launches the built in keyboard picker dialogue Allows you to pick a keyboard app to use and then closes.

Automatically closes after 5 seconds if nothing is picked.

This is intended to run as a shortcut from either the pie menu or some gesture type shortcuts.

This was created because when using some gesture navigation the keyboard picker on the nav bar can sometimes not be present. This is a very rare use case senario but I find it handy and maybe some other people will also.
